# TheHunt
A dueling card game based in the Half-Continent

*"In the bog-ridden reaches of the Half-Continent, monster hunting is not a calling — it’s a contract."*

In *The Hunt: Rivalries*, you and your opponent are rival teratologists, competing to best beasts, earn repute, and survive the strict scrutiny of the League. Build your 60-card deck from a mix of potent Heroes, alchemical Charges, and cunning Foils. Every turn, you’ll draw contracts to hunt strange and terrible creatures — but success depends on timing, synergy, and outwitting your rival before they steal your kill… or sabotage your preparations.

With fast-paced turns, meaningful decisions, and rich Half-Continent lore woven into every card, The Hunt offers a unique blend of deckbuilding, risk, and ruthless bureaucracy. Will you rise through reputation — or fall to Breach and shame?
